# Spatialization using Ambisonics (1)

## Ambisonics
A technology to store/stream spatial audio without defining the output format such as stereo, quad, 5.1, 8 or 16 channels.

This is helpful when you want to compose your surround music using 4 channel setup in the studio and playback it in a good concert hall with 16 speakers.

In addition to that, you can simulate the surround speaker setup using headphones. It means you can draft your music using headphones and master it in a studio.

## Sound Field Microphone

- Download the following three files. 
- In a patch, play all of them in an endless loop and rotate the position of them using the listener's position as a pivot as illustrated below
- Place three sources in three different distances and rotate them at three different speeds.
- One of the three sources should be rotated clockwise and the rest should be counterclockwise
